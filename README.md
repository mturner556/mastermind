# mastermind
Project: Mastermind from The Odin Project course.

For this project I will use the standard rules, which can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game). The game will be played in a series of twelve rounds. The Code Breaker and Code Setter will have 6 color choices to choose from. Feedback will be given in with 2 color (white and black). White will mean correct colors but incorrect position, and black will mean correct color and correct postion. The postion of the feedback colors will not corrolate with the postion of the guessed colors.
